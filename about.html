      <div class="ptext">
        <p>Gabriella Kauffmann is a renowned Danish visual artist whose paintings navigate the intersection between the intuitive and the conceptual. Her works go beyond aesthetic contemplation - they demand presence.</p>
        <p>
          With a background in both artistic practice and embodied perception, Kauffmann creates pieces that resonate with something deeply human. We spoke with her about her artistic approach, her creative process - and her perspective on the role
          of art in a world in constant flux.

          Gabriella Kauffmann was born in Copenhagen in 1960 and has lived in Paris and Frankfurt before returning to Copenhagen, where her studio is now located in Hellerup. She describes her art as narratives about human relationships and the
          energy and connection that exist between people.
        </p>
        <p>
          She studied art at Académie d'Art Rodere and La Grande Chaumière in Paris, as well as at Goethe University in Frankfurt. Her art focuses on the inner and outer limitations of the human being and seeks to highlight the universal connection
          between people.

          <p>Art has always been a constant in my life, but it was only when I felt a profound need to create with both body and mind that I fully embraced a professional artistic practice.</p>
          <p>My background as a reflexologist has taught me a great deal about sensory awareness, energy, and presence - all of which I continue to carry into my studio.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>In fact, art and healing share a fundamental commonality: they are both about connection, about being present in the moment, and about listening to what cannot always be expressed in words.</p>
          <p>
            My paintings stem from a curiosity about the connections and energetic fields we are part of - both visible and invisible. I often work in mixed media and incorporate three-dimensional elements to create depth and a sense of physical
            resonance in the works.
