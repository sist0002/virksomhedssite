          Gabriella Kauffmann is a renowned Danish visual artist whose paintings
          navigate the intersection between the intuitive and the conceptual.
          Her works go beyond aesthetic contemplation - they demand presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a background in both artistic practice and embodied perception,
          Kauffmann creates pieces that resonate with something deeply human. We
          spoke with her about her artistic approach, her creative process - and
          her perspective on the role of art in a world in constant flux.

          Gabriella Kauffmann was born in Copenhagen in 1960 and has lived in
          Paris and Frankfurt before returning to Copenhagen, where her studio
          is now located in Hellerup. She describes her art as narratives about
          human relationships and the energy and connection that exist between
          people.
        </p>
        <p>
          She studied art at Académie d'Art Rodere and La Grande Chaumière in
          Paris, as well as at Goethe University in Frankfurt. Her art focuses
          on the inner and outer limitations of the human being and seeks to
          highlight the universal connection between people.

            Art has always been a constant in my life, but it was only when I
            felt a profound need to create with both body and mind that I fully
            embraced a professional artistic practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            My background as a reflexologist has taught me a great deal about
            sensory awareness, energy, and presence - all of which I continue to
            carry into my studio.

            In fact, art and healing share a fundamental commonality: they are
            both about connection, about being present in the moment, and about
            listening to what cannot always be expressed in words.
          </p>
          <p>
            My paintings stem from a curiosity about the connections and
            energetic fields we are part of - both visible and invisible. I
            often work in mixed media and incorporate three-dimensional elements
            to create depth and a sense of physical resonance in the works.
