      <h2>STRUCTURES IN NET</h2>
      <p>
        Usually my work starts by looking inside myself and then outside from the inside. From the maze of questions and impressions in the multidimensional world we are living in, I see patterns, structures, reproductions being systematically
        repeated. Words, actions, behaviours, thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at nature, humans, a cell, renewing and perishing, renewing and perishing endlessly. Full of wonder I quiet my mind listens to the language of the heart. I surrender like a tree, with roots into the earth and with the crown up in the
        sky.
      </p>
      <p>With Structures in Net I’m creating a new alphabet a new and unknown language. It’s soundless but will be felt when silence enters.</p>
