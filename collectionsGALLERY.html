        <h2>STRUCTURES IN NET</h2>
        <p>
          Usually my work starts by looking inside myself and then outside from the inside. From the maze of questions and impressions in the multidimensional world we are living in, I see patterns, structures, reproductions being systematically
          repeated. Words, actions, behaviours, thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at nature, humans, a cell, renewing and perishing, renewing and perishing endlessly. Full of wonder I quiet my mind listens to the language of the heart. I surrender like a tree, with roots into the earth and with the crown up in
          the sky.
        </p>
        <p>With Structures in Net I’m creating a new alphabet a new and unknown language. It’s soundless but will be felt when silence enters.</p>

        <h2>REFLECTION OF MODERN LIFE</h2>
        <p>
          Structure by definition is the relation among elements. In this environment I’m especially interested in human beings. In my work I’m investigating the energy within, around and between people. We all exist in a space of energy that gives
          structure to our life.
        </p>
        <p>The square and many layers in my paintings symbolize the structure of formless energy, which in this context are feelings, thoughts and memories. Selected work from 2010 and forward.</p>

        <h2>EXPLORING VITALITY IN RELATIONS</h2>
        <p>
          Focus is essential and one should never be afraid of simple compositions. As long as the working method is based on spontaneity and is part of an experiment. It is important to take time, time to look, time to think - time to be focused and
          offer your love for what you do.
        </p>
        <p>This applies to everything in life, not just in art. I have never been afraid of single minded and colourful paintings. Selected work from the period 2000 – 2009.</p>

        <h2>INFLUENCED BY COBRA</h2>
        <p>Colour is a power and I’ve always insisted as an artist to express myself in a colourful way.</p>
        <p>It’s all about freedom in colour and form. You should focus and cultivate your childish instincts, such as spontaneity and impulse, rather than a bothering reproduction of the world around you.</p>
        <p>I think all my years in Paris and Frankfurt taught me to exploit the free expression of my subconscious and go with my instincts. Selected work from the period until 2000.</p>
