          Dive into a selection of works where structure, relation and colour
          open spaces for reflection. Each piece offers traces of an artistic
          practice shaped by observation, movement and emotion.

          From the maze of questions and impressions in the multidimensional
          world we are living in, I see patterns, structures, reproductions
          being systematically repeated. Words, actions, behaviours, thoughts.

          Structure by definition is the relation among elements. We all exist
          in a space of energy that gives structure to our life.
