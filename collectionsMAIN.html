        <p>From the maze of questions and impressions in the multidimensional world we are living in, I see patterns, structures, reproductions being systematically repeated. Words, actions, behaviours, thoughts.</p>

          Colour is a power and I’ve always insisted as an artist to express myself in a colourful way. It’s all about freedom in colour and form. You should focus and cultivate your childish instincts, such as spontaneity and impulse, rather than a
          bothering reproduction of the world around you.
